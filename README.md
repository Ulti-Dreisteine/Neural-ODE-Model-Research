# Neural-ODE-Model-Research
A project aiming for realizing the **ODE Network** proposed by Ricky T. Q. Chen et al. in 2019

### CSTR Simulation
  1. run the following codes:  
    ```
    python lib.run_cstr_simulation.py
    ```  
    relevant figures and data are saved in "file/" and "data/"

### TODOs:  
  1. ~~Build a nonlinear ODE model for generating samples~~
  2. Build the ODE Net for re-constructing the system's manifolds
